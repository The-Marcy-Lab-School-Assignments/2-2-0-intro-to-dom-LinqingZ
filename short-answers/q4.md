# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
Use .innerHTML when you need to set or update a large chunk of HTML content at once and when simplicity is preferred. Use .createElement and node manipulation methods when you need finer control over DOM elements, want to avoid overwriting existing content, or are concerned about performance for complex updates. 
createElement is faster, as browsers are not required to parse the HTML string and then build a node tree out of it; it also doesn't have to attach event listeners as innerHTML does. Using innerHTML will cause browsers to reparse and recreate all DOM nodes inside the element whose innerHTML is modified.
